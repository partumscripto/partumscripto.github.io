# Poem for The Greenland Shark


You are the best animal ( Iâ€™m not so sure though)

The thing that I donâ€™t like about you is that you arenâ€™t as fluffy as dough!!!ðŸ˜¡

So you wonâ€™t give me gifts like Santa Clause and say HO HO!!! ðŸ˜¹ðŸ˜­

Too bad that you are blind 

But can even smell behind

the window blinds!!!

And you are so old

And not so bold 

So even if I sell you, I wonâ€™t have a pot of gold!!

And all you eat

Is all only meat

And you wonâ€™t have a lot of heat!!!

Though you are not so smart

You still have a heart

So donâ€™t get shot by a dart!!!
