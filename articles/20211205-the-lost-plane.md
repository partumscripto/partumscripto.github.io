# The Lost Plane

One day, a plane came to Africa. The pilot thought it was strange because he started from America to Africa, but it only took 1 single hour. When he was looking for an airport, he couldnâ€™t find any.  Suddenly, the plane shook and the pilot found out that a giraffe was eating the plane. He quickly flew away and the plane crashed. He got out of his plane the moment it crashed. He was stuck here in Africa!!! 

After he got out of the plane, he looked around. He was panicking at first, then he remembered, he brought some food. He went to his broken plane, then found out that he had only brought 2 pieces of bread. He thought it was at least better than nothing. He decided to bring the bread. He got his water bottle too. He was walking around to find water until he was itchy. He thought it was normal until he saw a big big big big big mosquito on his hand, and he brushed it away. He saw blood dripping, and he really needed to find a stream! 

Then he saw a piece of metal. He thought it was strange because it was brown but his plane color was red. After he walked a bit more, he saw a small stream. He ran to it, then he drank some water and washed his mosquito bite. He got out the bread and ate a little of the bread. He ate a little because he had to survive and he needed food. 

He saw a big stone and saw a fish. Then he threw the stone at the fish. He got the fish!!! He was so happy and ate it for his dinner. He saw a giraffe near him and thought, if I killed a fish the first time using a stone, then I can do that to the giraffe too!!! He gathered rocks and threw all of them at the giraffe, but the giraffe kicked the man when not even the first stone landed. He killed some more fish. He refilled his water bottle and went back to the plane for shelter. 

He woke up and brought his belongings. He walked around and saw fences. He saw people staring at him. Kids were eating lollipops. He knew what was going on. He was in a zoo!!!

People working at the zoo opened the door and let him out.  They asked what happened and when the pilot told them, they were laughing. They helped the pilot to fix his plane and the pilot went to Africa. Bye!
