# Being patient for doing something, and was it worth the wait?

When I was 3, my brother’s head bumped my chin and it was very painful. My mouth was bleeding a lot! My teeth felt loose. After a few days, 2 teeth fell out, but there were still pieces left. So I went to the dentist. The dentist saw the remains of the two teeth. The dentist said not to be scared and started yanking them out!!!!!! It was very fast and didn’t really hurt a bit. I was really patient and after that it even felt better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wasn’t angry at my brother because I forget stuff the next morning.
