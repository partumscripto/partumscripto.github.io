# My Happy Family is Good to Me, If You Don’t Believe Me, Come and See!

My mom sometimes helps me with my work\
And when she helps it doesn’t hurt. 

My dad tells me stories when I go to bed\
But he accidentally bumps his head. 

My baby brother is very funny\
He wishes he had a big, blue bunny. 

My mom knits blankets for my family\
The warmest blankets in the galaxy. 

My dad is helpful, he cares for me\
He wouldn’t even hurt a troublesome flea.

My brother loves to feed the ducks\
He thinks that this will bring him luck.

On my birthday, we go to the park\
On the wooden bench we eat an egg tart.

My family is a strong strand of DNA\
We stick together like sticky clay.

My family is happy, you can see\
Caring for each other is the key.
