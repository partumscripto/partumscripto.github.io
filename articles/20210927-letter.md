Dear Mr. Lewis,

Hello Iâ€™m Augustus, and you shouldnâ€™t know me. I am 8 years old and live in Hong Kong. I like this book but dislike some parts too. The part that I like was that the good guys won at last and had a happy ending. The part that I disliked was that when I read the book at night, I got nightmares!!!ðŸ˜¡ I also think Edmund shouldnâ€™t have taken taken that kind of road.  One thing that I donâ€™t understand is that why Mr. Tumnus becomes good so fast. But anyway, I liked the book, thank you for writing this book!!!ðŸ˜ƒ

Sincerely,\
Augustus Tse
