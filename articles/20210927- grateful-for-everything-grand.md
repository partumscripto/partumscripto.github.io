# Grateful For Everything Grand

I am raising up my hand
I am telling you what I am grateful for

Grateful for the snow
It is as white as muffin dough

Grateful for a gold kite
It shines brightly as light

Grateful for the picture, look!
Do you know that it’s inside the book?

Grateful for the clear air 
Luckily, I don’t have green hair

Grateful for my family
And with them, I am happy

Grateful for not going to hell
And in hell, they always fall in a well


Grateful for eating noodles
And always using Google

Grateful for grilled beef
And I love coral reefs

Grateful for all foods
And I am not rude

Grateful for Zoom
But I suddenly heard a boom

It was the horrific dragon 
And that dragon loves to eat wagons

Grateful for summer when I go to swim
But don’t like it when the weather gets dim

This is the thing that brings light
And there is no actual height
