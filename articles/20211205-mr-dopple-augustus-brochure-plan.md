What can Mr. Dopple-Gustus do?

Mr. Dopple-Gustus is the most advanced robot in the universe. Even aliens want to buy him! He can find any missing Lego pieces and tidy up your toys with his toy detector. He can pretend to be exactly like you in Zoom lessons, and answer any question the teacher asks (not like Mr. Hunger-Hunger, the dysfunctional robot!) He does all your hard homework. You donâ€™t even have to ask him! He can cook for you at home and can do anything you ask him to do. Mr. Dopple-Gustus never malfunctions. Heâ€™s even waterproof, so you wonâ€™t have to worry if he comes back from a big, heavy rain. The molten lava inside of him can melt all the water!



What makes Mr. Dopple-Gustus different?



My robot can find my missing Lego pieces,. More importantly, it can do my homework and pretend to be me in Zoom classes. It can detect toys using a toy detector. His eyes can see through time. Infinite memory storage, so he can always remember where a toy went. Constantly learning around people. Can speak like a human after a year. Always learning. After a year, he acts like a human. He wonâ€™t melt. He can save people in fires. He runs really fast. 

You can refund any time, not like Mr. Hunger-Hunger. Mr. Dopple-Gustus is very well behaved. He never acts like a dog!
