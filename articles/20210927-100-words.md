# Waiting for something, and was it worth the wait?

Sometimes when I need to get a toy, I need to get over 95 marks. When I get 95 marks I get ONE SMALL TOY. But when I get 100 marks, I get 2 small toys and one big toy. When I got 100 marks in my pop math quiz, I got 1 big toy and 2 small toys. The 1 big toy was a humongous Lego that was 18+. The small ones were Legos that were 11+. It was worth all my studying and hard work because I got a toy that I really wanted for a few months. 

Being patient for doing something, and was it worth the wait?

When I was 3, my brother’s head bumped my chin and it was very painful. My mouth was bleeding a lot! My teeth felt loose. After a few days, 2 teeth fell out, but there were still pieces left. So I went to the dentist. The dentist saw the remains of the two teeth. The dentist said not to be scared and started yanking them out!!!!!! It was very fast and didn’t really hurt a bit. I was really patient and after that it even felt better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wasn’t angry at my brother because I forget stuff the next morning.
