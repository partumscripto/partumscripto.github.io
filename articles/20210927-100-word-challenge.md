# 100-Word Challenge

A wizard Mr. David and his wife Ms. Marah lived on a mountain called Heja. Whoever eats Ms. David can live forever,  but he wouldn’t eat himself. So he wanted to find another Mr. David. He rode a horse, brought a suitcase and a key. He asked anyone if they’d seen Mr. David? He said in a Italian accent, “Yes, Ms. David who lives on a mountain.” The wizard thought if it is a Ms, it doesn’t really matter. So, he went home, ate his wife, but found out the person said it in a different way. He regretted it.
