# The Unexpected

When I woke up to go to school it was already raining. Only a little. When the car was in the middle of the road, it was raining heavily. The water was splashing outside of the car, but I was staying dry inside, so it was a little bit satisfying to watch. 

Usually when you go to school it takes about 30 minutes to get there, but it took around 45 minutes to get there because of the rain. Near my school, like around 5 minutes away, a bus was flooded with mud water. The people in the bus were reacting strangely. They were very scared and overreacting. They were panicking. 

Once I got to school I was wet. It took me about three hours to dry up. I wasnâ€™t sure if the birthday party would be cancelled. I felt worried and wanted time to speed up so that I could get back home and watch some TV. Instead, I was stuck in school. They said we could go out in five minutes, but it took one hour. 

One day, I was walking around my neighborhood. When I was walking, I passed through a house that had a yard sale. When I walked closer, I saw a submarine captain selling a submarine and other junk, I was so surprised. I asked the submarine captain if he was selling the submarine, and he said yes. I asked him how much it cost and he said it was only $100. I said I wanted to buy it and then he said ok. I asked him how I could  move the submarine, and he said figure it out yourself, so I ended up not buying the submarine and I walked back home. This was the weirdest day in my entire life.
