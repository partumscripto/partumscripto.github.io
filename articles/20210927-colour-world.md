# The Color World

One day, a man was buying a curtain because he needed a new one. He went to the curtain store and saw a big curtain. So he walked closer and opened it. He was surprised to see a world of colour. Actually, he didn’t know what to call it because he was from a black and white world.

He saw a small boy and he was scared because he had never seen any person in color and found out that he had colors, too. He thought, where am I????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Who are you and who am I???????????????????????????????????????

The kid just responded, “On earth.” 

The man was so so so surprised to see that the kid could read his mind, and he asked, “What is happening?” 

The kid replied, “You will find out soon enough.” The boy just disappeared. The man was so scared of the kid so he was feeling better after the boy disappeared.

The man didn’t like this world and wanted to go back to his game world, but the curtain didn’t have any way to get out. He was horrified.

The kid came back again, and the man fainted. The kid tried to help the man wake up, and after the man woke up, he ran away. The boy stayed back at home because he knew the man would come back.

After a week, he did come back and wasn’t so horrified any more. The kid just appeared again and said, “ZZZZZZZZZZ.” The kid was asleep.
The man didn’t dare touch him, and the man fell asleep too.

The boy woke up first and sat down and waited. The man woke up the next day. The man was at first horrified but, after a while, he became ok.

The man asked, “Why am I here? What is happening? Where are my friends? How can I go back?”

The boy said, “You are here because you accidentally fell into the colour world, and your friends are still in the world that you came from. You can go back by using a ladder to climb up that curtain.” 

The man looked up and saw the curtain above him on the ceiling. There it was, the curtain. The man told the boy that he wanted to go back to the black and white world, so the kid gave the man a book and told him to keep it. The kid got a ladder for the man to climb up and, before the man went back to his black and white world, he told the kid goodbye. 

When the man returned, he told his family and friends. He showed the book which the kid gave him. 

Inside the book was a picture of the color world. He remembered the world forever.
