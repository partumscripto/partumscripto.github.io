# The Treasure Map

I was walking to school, and found a treasure map. At school, I didn’t tell anybody about this treasure map. After school, I went to find the treasure. 

I opened the treasure map and was surprised to see what’s inside. It was familiar to me because it had a few places that I knew. But, the trees looked strange. I don’t have any memories that there was a tree in that area. When I went there, there really was a tree! Yesterday, I didn’t see that there was any tree in that area, but today there was. I thought something was fishy. But when I saw that there was another tree inside the map,  I thought it was strange why would someone draw a normal tree inside a treasure map and just leave it there.

So I really went to find the treasure. When I climbed the tree that said it had treasure in it, but there weren’t any treasures. Then I got out my treasure map, turned the map upside down, and saw that the other tree was where the treasure was! Then, I went to the other tree and saw a treasure box inside the tree. 

When I opened it, I saw a dinosaur egg.  I knew it was a dinosaur egg because I have seen it in a book. I quickly brought my dinosaur egg back home and showed my family. Afterwards, I kept it in my room and put it in a secret place. Nobody knew where it was.
