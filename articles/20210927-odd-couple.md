One day, a ship from Argentina was blown off course, and the only survivors found their ship shipwrecked in Antarctica. They arrived on shore and said to each other, “I am so hungry!”

The chimpanzee saw the iguana and said, “Yeah! I found a yummy iguana to eat!!!😃”

The iguana (which didn’t hear what the chimpanzee said) said, “Yeah, that big fat chimpanzee is going to be my delicious meal for a year!” 
 
The chimpanzee said, “And I can drink the lizard’s saliva!”
 
The iguana (which didn’t hear what the chimpanzee said, again) said, “And I can drink some water in the monkey’s mouth!”
 
Nearby, a penguin saw the chimpanzee and the iguana and was surprised to see them there. So he quickly swam over and saw them exhausted sleeping on the ground. The penguin carried them back to the igloo and waited for them to wake up. After a few hours, they woke up and asked where they were. The penguin replied that they were in Antarctica because of a ship wreck and ended up in Antarctica.
 
They asked, “Who are you? You look like a bird and a human and with a lot of fur!!!”
 
The penguin replied, “I am a penguin!!!😡”
 
The penguin gave some food to them to eat and a hot chocolate for them to drink. Because there was no boat coming, they slept at the penguin’s igloo. After a few days they saw a ship coming towards them. The penguin said they can go back home now. At last they said farewell to the penguin and said they would visit him when they have time and left.
